Hi,

My only purpose is to create a directory, because VS2013 does not want to create an empty directory.
But I plan to be more than a text file. You'll see, I'll have more use in the future.
And perhaps, one day, I'll use you. Yes you, the reader. I'll be your master !
Today, a directory. Tomorrow, the world !


Your favorite text file,
README
